# elf4j-slf4j

The [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) service provider binding for the Easy Logging Facade for
Java ([ELF4J](https://github.com/elf4j/elf4j-api)) SPI

## User story

As a service provider of the Easy Logging Facade for Java (ELF4J) SPI, I want to bind the logging capabilities of
SLF4J
to the ELF4J client application via
the [Java Service Provider Interfaces (SPI)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html) mechanism,
so that any application using the ELF4J API for logging can opt to use the SLF4J framework at deployment time without
code change.

## Prerequisite

- Java 8+
- [ELF4J](https://github.com/elf4j/elf4j-api) 7.0.0+
- SLF4J 2.0.3+

## Get it...

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.elf4j/elf4j-slf4j.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22io.github.elf4j%22%20AND%20a:%22elf4j-slf4j%22)

## Use it...

If you are using the [ELF4J API](https://github.com/elf4j/elf4j-api#the-client-api) for logging, and wish to select or
change to use SLF4J as the run-time implementation, then simply pack this binding JAR in the classpath when the
application deploys. No code change needed. At compile time, the client code is unaware of this run-time logging service
provider. Because of the ELF4J API, opting for SLF4J as the logging implementation is a deployment-time decision.

The usual [SLF4J configuration](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping) applies.

With Maven, an end-user application would use this provider as a dependency of the `runtime` scope:

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.elf4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>elf4j-slf4j</artifactId>
            <scope>runtime</scope>
        </dependency>
```

Note: A library, API, or server/container codebase would use the `test` or `provided` scope; or just use the ELF4J API -
without any SPI provider like this, at all. Only one logging provider should be loaded and working at run-time; the
facilitating codebase should leave the provider choice to the end-user application.
